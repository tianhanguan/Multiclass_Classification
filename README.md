# Structure of the project report
Section 1 discusses the One-vs-All and One-vs-One method which are techniques to transform a multiclass classification problem into multiple binary classification problems. 

Section 2 outlines the multinomial logistic regression and discusses why it is not sufficient in many cases.

Section 3 applies different multiclass classification methods to the Letter Image Recognition dataset, and compares the model performance as well as provides some insights on each method. Programming in this project are done using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library.
